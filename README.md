## Introduction

N42 introduces a secure, efficient, and globally interconnected digital ecosystem, empowering developers to build applications with maximum autonomy and interoperability. Designed as a high-performance public blockchain, N42 utilizes Go for its exceptional concurrency, scalability, and ease of deployment, ensuring a robust and highly efficient environment.

Featuring a modular, sharded architecture, N42 delivers high transaction throughput and advanced data processing—key elements for building globally connected digital infrastructure. Its permissionless framework enables effortless integration and efficient data exchange across a wide range of applications, paving the way for the next generation of decentralized internet services.

**Disclaimer:** This software is currently a tech preview. We will do our best to keep it stable and avoid breaking changes, but we make no guarantees.

## System Requirements

- **Storage**: ≥ 200 GB (SSD or NVMe recommended; HDD not recommended)
- **Memory**: ≥ 16 GB RAM
- **CPU**: 64-bit architecture
- **Go Version**: [≥ 1.19](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Building from Source

### Linux and macOS

To build N42 from source, you must have the latest version of Go installed.

- Installation instructions: [Go installation page](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Download Go: [Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/)

Clone the repository and compile:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/n42blockchain/n42.git
cd n42
make n42
./build/bin/n42
```

### Windows

Windows users may run N42 in three ways:

- **Native binaries**: Build using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
- **Docker**: See [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
- **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**:
    - Install and build as on Linux
    - Ensure storage is on Linux filesystem for best performance

### Docker Container

Docker allows easy building and running without installing dependencies on the host OS.

See: [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml), [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

Convenient Docker commands:

```sh
make images # Build Docker images containing N42 binaries
make up     # docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
make down   # docker-compose down && clean docker data
make start  # docker-compose start && docker-compose logs -f
make stop   # docker-compose stop
```

## Executables
